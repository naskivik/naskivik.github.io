<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>YouTube, in all its corporate glory, facilitates pro-faggotry and egregious filtering of creations deemed by them to be detestable from the viewpoint of a glass eye, easily shattered by mere sight of transgression based on their own irritable policies. This has led to the website being permeated with rubbish, primarily low-effort creations, and filler meant to appease its algorithm designed to throttle a creator if one dares to renounce its focus, while at the same time is intentionally designed to keep its viewers, who at once were customers then mentally raped into becoming habitu√©s, into consuming the detritus that its publishers are entrapped formulating (as said before, one step out of line will lead to engagements being retarded) for multiple hours at a time while primarily ignoring the great world of art that invites them to embrace. At times, there have been multiple attempts to replicate or create a full-on YouTube clone and turn it into a less capitalized zone, but have either failed, either becoming not commercially feasible and being forced to shut down or left in the dust as its inhabitants return to the urban landscape. They have simply gotten enormous because they went in early and scooped up all the market share before anyone else could have gotten a good piece of it.</p>
<p>The author of this site refuses to step in line with YouTubes policies and as a result, has experienced censorship from its fragile glass eye. This serves as an alternative if the inevitable termination were to occur.</p>
<p>Peep the works below. Whether you like it or not is up to your judgment. They are the original uncensored versions.</p><br>
