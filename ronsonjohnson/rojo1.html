<h3>Basic Info</h3>
<p>Ronson Johnson is the product of 4 years of development.</p>
<p>The game was an idea trying to be put in development for a long time, switching ideas and engines, trying to fit what will be right. It went from Game Maker, to Unity, even almost becoming a DOOM WAD at some point. The narrative went from being a "Postal-clone", a survival game, to finally becoming the game we know today.</p>
<p>The game was developed in almost a week, even though being in years in development hell.</p>
<p>The game was released as a joke and was meant to get out of the developers head after being stuck in there for years.</p>
<p>The team of people who were making the game was around 5 at some point, but then lead to naskivik himself making everything, even voice acting every character with a cheap phone.</p>
<p>After release, it was met with critical acclaim and negative reviews, dividing people between how they like the game. The way that naskivik got these is that he sent people the game before release and told him how they liked it.</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>You are Ronson Johnson, a soldier who has just finished an ambush invading the enemy base. You were in the conference room, reading enemy plans to figure out what they will do in the future to plan and fight back against them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, the other person who supported you in the ambush gets assassinated. Johnson finds out that the enemy is trying to steal back the plans so that no one would know. He tries to get the plan back and get revenge for killing his friend.</p>
<p>He infiltrates the known enemy base and tries to clear it all and discovers that the enemy side is building high-tech robots to attack the other side.</p>
<p>Johnsons plan is to get rid of these robots to help his side and win their war. The leader of the enemy side is informed about this and deploys soldiers to kill him. Johnson plows through them and tries to kill the leader. After he kills one of their robots, he falls unconscious in the blast and the leader dumps him in a coffin in the middle of the desert.</p>
<p>Luckily, someone of another side tries to help him and he is too, trying to get rid of the enemies. He leads Johnson to another base that has nuclear bombs, and Johnson steals the codes. He goes back to the other base, and reroutes the nuclear bombs to the enemy base. But to do that, he has to defeat another prototype robot, a mech.</p>
<p>After the mech was defeated, Johnson finds the enemy leader and finishes him off.</p>
